Change log for CMSFDT

2025-01     Lots of fixes, some refactoring
	    Moved some 'generic' function in the support file (cmsfdtcommon),
	    changed configuration to use the functions. Swish is fixed but
	    need to be installed separately. Remove flowplayer because it's
	    useless, added management for videos (mp4).
	    Updated CKEditor (sometimes ago).
	    Removed stuff related to the firewall management.
2022-08     Added example Apache configuration file, added script to install required Perl modules, commented
            Swish search engine (need to fix it), fixed possible Xss bug in doc.pl, fixed "bug" for Perl 5.25 that
            doesn't have '.' in INC, added Firewall table and management.

            ToDo: fix swish.
