Cms Fdt Sources
Version 5.1.3 Jan. 2025

This application requires the following Perl modules:

 DBI
 CGI
 CGI::Cookie
 Config::General
 Date::Format
 Date::Parse
 Digest::MD5
 XML::RSS
 File::Temp
 LWP::UserAgent
 URI::Find
 NetAddr::IP

And SWISH

They should be available in any Perl distribution. Also you'll need a database, either PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Scripts for the creation of the databases are in the scripts directory.

Also: you'll need to install CKEditor, best way is to download from their website, I've removed the source from here because it was a pain in the butt.

Example configuration for Apache is in apache-conf
